- Class should implement the 'Comparable' interface: Media
- In the class that implement the 'Comparable' interface (Media), we can do as follow:

    @Override
        public int compareTo(Media m) {
            int titleCompare = this.getTitle().compareTo(m.getTitle());
            if (titleCompare != 0) return titleCompare;
            return Double.compare(this.getCost(), m.getCost());
        }

- No, with the Comparable interface, we can define only one natural ordering in the compareTo method.
To have multiple ordering rules, we need to use the Comparator interface.

- If DVDs have a different ordering rule (by title, then decreasing length, then cost),
we can override the compareTo method and change the method to compare title first, and then length and then cost.
