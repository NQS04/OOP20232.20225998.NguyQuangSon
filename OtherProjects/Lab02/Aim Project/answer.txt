#Section10: Yes, we can create multile constructor methods within a class DVD, each with a different parameter list (by title of by category)

#Section15:
+ Java is a "Pass by Value" programming language.

+ After the call of "swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD)" the title of these two 
objects still remain because: we just swapped the references  of these two objects locally, and still remain outside the methods

+ After the call of "changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle())" the title
of the JungleDVD changed because: Inside the changeTitle method, the title of jungleDVD is changed using the setTitle method. 
The title is changed because we are directly modifying the DigitalVideoDisc object referred to by the jungleDVD reference.
